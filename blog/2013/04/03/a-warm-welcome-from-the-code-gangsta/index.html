<p>The day finally has arrived. I am starting a blog.</p>

<h2 id="introduction:bba323f1579cac96bc73bbc1d718e96a">Introduction</h2>

<p>For those of you who do not know me, my name is Jeremy Saenz. I have been building software since graduating high school. Discovering that I did not want to attend college, I naturally picked up software engineering as a passionate craft that I care deeply about.</p>

<p>Back in 2008 I was just starting to wade (drown perhaps is the better word) through the vast sea of knowledge that is the software engineering industry. I began my journey by programming Adobe Flex apps with Actionscript 3. To ease the pain of entering an industry completely void of prior relationships and contacts, I decided to create a gangsta-rap video that was related to tech (Flex specifically).</p>

<p>Thus, the Flex Gangsta was born!</p>

<h2 id="the-flex-gangsta:bba323f1579cac96bc73bbc1d718e96a">The Flex Gangsta</h2>

<p>The video instantly propelled me into the industry. In all humbleness and honesty it was a scary time for me. I was gracefully accepted into as a community member when I did not <em>really</em> know how to write code!</p>

<p>With the help of some wonderful mentors I eventually <em>did</em> learn how to write code, and write it well. I began speaking at conferences and continued to produce rap songs and videos for the fun of it.</p>

<h2 id="recently:bba323f1579cac96bc73bbc1d718e96a">Recently&hellip;</h2>

<p>The last couple years yielded an abundance of knowledge and experience, ranging from building key modules for a large social game to designing and implementing a full fledged driving game that is deployed/featured at auto shows across the country.</p>

<p>My more recent endeavor (~1yr) has been working with the fantastic team over at <a href="http://theengine.co/">The Engine Co.</a> The team has been tirelessly working to deliver a rapid and pragmatic workflow/platform for developing cross-platform mobile games. Loom, our flagship product, has recently launched and is building a strong community of developers dedicated to make this platform a lasting value to the mobile games industry.</p>

<p>At The Engine Co. our driving philosophy is to use the best tool for the job. Building a tooling workflow and development platform requires us to touch Java, Obj-C, C, C++, Ruby, C#, and LoomScript (our homegrown language) to get the job done right.</p>

<p>Today I am touching many different technologies, and thus I change my alias from the <strong>Flex Gangsta</strong> to <strong>Code Gangsta</strong>. The purpose of this blog is to document some solutions I discover in my day to day.</p>

<p>Thanks for joining me on this adventure, now let&rsquo;s write some software!</p>
